Welcome to Tumkur Diaries! ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a20107c9-e991-4243-9870-d0d9dac372dd.jpg)

It has been an exiciting 12 months journey of conceptualisation, brain-storming ideas, fund-raising, design and execution of our first ever crowd funded dream project on 'Financial Wellness for Young Women in Semi-Rural Areas of India! We thought it will be a great idea to share with you our awesome journey of 12 months through a narrative of stories, images , info-graphics and videos! All of these in a Journal Format to make it more personal, fun and interactive! 

Hope you enjoy reading our Tumkur Diaries and some of you get inspired and motivated to launch your own dream project!

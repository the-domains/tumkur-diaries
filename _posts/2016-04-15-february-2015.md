February 2015

One day  I was just few minutes into my coaching session with my Life Coach [Vaishnavi Viswanathan][0] . The session was on goal setting  for the financial year 2015-16 \[In India, we follow the April to March calendar for Financial Year\].  Vaishnavi initiated the session with a guided meditation and then suggested me to visualize a scenery and also imagine a person with whom I would like to have a conversation on my goals for the new financial year. I imagined being in a 'Gurukul' setting \[ As you might be aware, Gurukul setting is an ancient system of learning in India through masters and one learns as a student through intent listening, reading out loud, observations, conversations, sharing and reflecting experiences and insights from the Guru\] . I had imagined the Shantiniketan as my setting near the banks of a river and was contemplating on the goals/projects for the year. This was just about a week before my  close friend  from U.S. [Rick Kahler ][1]was to arrive in India for conducting a workshop for my fellow financial planners and advisors. Vaishnavi was facilitating this beautiful session and throughout the session I imagined Rick to be my ancient guru and having conversations with him. When I mentioned my goal is to serve more millennial women from now on, he mentioned three things:  ' Do whatever you feel like' ,'Try', 'Experiment'.  And the sitting posture was exactly like the ancient gurus. Very relaxed. When I look back, I firmly believe that the idea to focus more on 'women and financial wellness' originated from that day onwards. I am extremely thankful and grateful to Vaishnavi and Rick for having sown the seeds of the project!

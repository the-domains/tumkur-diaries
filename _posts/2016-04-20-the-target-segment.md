This month was the most crucial month of the project. It helped us to decide on the niche target segment of women to reach out for our Women Empowerment Program. Another coaching session with Vaishnavi in the fourth week of March, brought clarity and purpose to the project. Our coaching session was focused on resolving my dilemma of self care vs selfless service. Vaishnavi listened to my predicament patiently, asked deep questions and finally helped me make the choice by displaying a number of powerful picture post cards. She asked me to pick the one I feel close to in the context of self care and selfless service. I chose this young woman's picture because she was literally speaking with me through her eyes. She was saying, ' Come on over and empower us on what you know the best is for us'. This picture nailed it. Both ways. Resolved my dilemma as well as identifying the target segment for our project.

I realized on that day how coaching through a Life Coach can be so powerful in helping us to identify that 'One Thing' that we want to achieve and go for it. Every Single Day.
